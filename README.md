# Introduction to Godot Engine 4

[This is a tutorial series for how to get started with Godot Engine 4](https://catlikecoding.com/godot/introduction/), by building a clock and doing stuff with it. We begin as simple as possible and gradually introduce more advanced concepts.

This series is aimed at beginners who are completely new to game development, but more advanced developers that are new to Godot will also find it useful.

Each Individual tutorial has its own numbered folder.
